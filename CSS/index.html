    <h1>Math</h1>
    <p>Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself.
         There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).</p>

    <p>Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. 
        Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation.
         Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. 
         Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.</p>
